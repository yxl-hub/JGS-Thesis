	abstract = {Barras, Scaillet, and Wermers propose the false discovery rate ({FDR}) to separate skill (alpha) from luck in fund performance. Using simulations with parameters informed by the data, we ﬁnd that this methodology is conservative and underestimates the proportion of nonzero-alpha funds. For example, 65\% of funds with economically large alphas of ±2\% are misclassiﬁed as zero alpha. This bias arises from the low signalto-noise ratio in fund returns and the resulting low statistical power. Our results question {FDR}’s applicability in performance evaluation and other domains with low power, and can materially change the conclusion that most funds have zero alpha.},

	title = {False discoveries in mutual fund performance: Measuring luck in estimated alphas},
	abstract = {This paper develops a simple technique that controls for “false discoveries,” or mutual funds that exhibit signiﬁcant alphas by luck alone. Our approach precisely separates funds into (1) unskilled, (2) zero-alpha, and (3) skilled funds, even with dependencies in cross-fund estimated alphas. We ﬁnd that 75\% of funds exhibit zero alpha (net of expenses), consistent with the Berk and Green equilibrium. Further, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant proportion of skilled (positive alpha) funds prior to 1996, but almost none by 2006. We also show that controlling for false discoveries substantially improves the ability to ﬁnd the few funds with persistent performance.},

	abstract = {The e-{BH} procedure is an e-value-based multiple testing procedure that provably controls the false discovery rate ({FDR}) under any dependence structure between the e-values. Despite this appealing theoretical {FDR} control guarantee, the e-{BH} procedure often suffers from low power in practice. In this paper, we propose a general framework that boosts the power of e-{BH} without sacrificing its {FDR} control under arbitrary dependence. This is achieved by the technique of conditional calibration, where we take as input the e-values and calibrate them to be a set of “boosted e-values” that are guaranteed to be no less—and are often more—powerful than the original ones. Our general framework is explicitly instantiated in three classes of multiple testing problems: (1) testing under parametric models, (2) conditional independence testing under the model-X setting, and (3) model-free conformalized selection. Extensive numerical experiments show that our proposed method significantly improves the power of e-{BH} while continuing to control the {FDR}. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through an application to an observational study dataset for identifying individuals whose counterfactuals satisfy certain properties.},

Assuming observable factors with a weak correlation structure for the idiosyncratic error, we propose a spatial-sign based multiple testing procedure ({SS}-{BH}). When latent factors are present, we first extract them using the elliptical principle component method (He et al., 2022) and then propose a factor-adjusted spatial-sign based multiple testing procedure ({FSS}-{BH}). Simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed {FSS}-{BH} procedure performs exceptionally well across various applications and exhibits robustness to variations in the covariance structure and the distribution of the error term. Additionally, real data application further highlights the superiority of the {FSS}-{BH} procedure.},

	shorttitle = {Skilled Mutual Fund Selection},
	abstract = {Selecting skilled mutual funds through the multiple testing framework has received increasing attention from ﬁnance researchers and statisticians. The intercept α of Carhart four-factor model is commonly used to measure the true performance of mutual funds, and positive α’s are considered as skilled. We observe that the standardized {OLS} estimates of α’s across the funds possess strong dependence and nonnormality structures, indicating that the conventional multiple testing methods are inadequate for selecting the skilled funds. We start from a decision theoretic perspective, and propose an optimal multiple testing procedure to minimize a combination of false discovery rate and false non-discovery rate. Our proposed testing procedure is constructed based on the probability of each fund not being skilled conditional on the information across all of the funds in our study. To model the distribution of the information used for the testing procedure, we consider a mixture model under dependence and propose a new method called “approximate empirical Bayes” to ﬁt the parameters. Empirical studies show that our selected skilled funds have superior long-term and short-term performance, e.g., our selection strongly outperforms the S\&P 500 index during the same period.},

	abstract = {E-values have gained attention as potential alternatives to p-values as measures of uncertainty, significance and evidence. In brief, e-values are realized by random variables with expectation at most one under the null; examples include betting scores, (point null) Bayes factors, likelihood ratios and stopped supermartingales. We design a natural analogue of the Benjamini-Hochberg ({BH}) procedure for false discovery rate ({FDR}) control that utilizes e-values, called the e-{BH} procedure, and compare it with the standard procedure for p-values. One of our central results is that, unlike the usual {BH} procedure, the e-{BH} procedure controls the {FDR} at the desired level—with no correction—for any dependence structure between the e-values. We illustrate that the new procedure is convenient in various settings of complicated dependence, structured and post-selection hypotheses, and multi-armed bandit problems. Moreover, the {BH} procedure is a special case of the e-{BH} procedure through calibration between p-values and e-values. Overall, the e-{BH} procedure is a novel, powerful and general tool for multiple testing under dependence, that is complementary to the {BH} procedure, each being an appropriate choice in different applications.},
